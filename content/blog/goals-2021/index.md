### Recap

This year has been tough. Living in the UK and faced with lockdown for most of the year, my goals shifted a lot from taking on the world, to staying sane!

At a retrospective - it's fair to say In the past I have been over ambitious with my goal selection.

I have tried the extreme, listing every area in my life, setting goals, then projects against them etc. Whilst I do believe this promotes a well balanced life and I really like the idea on paper - for me it becomes an operation burdon, and a drain on my energy juggling goals in every area, continuously.

This year I want to rely on habits more, reducing required motivation to achieve a lot more, getting "free" productivity in certain areas. E.G daily medititation / journaling

Outside my my habits, whilst i'll stick with goals - I prefer not to always rely on well defined projects projects and tasks (although they certainly have a place). Instead focus on a daily highlight, that makes my day "worth it".

## Habits

In order to improve habits stickyness, and not overwhelm myself trying to tackle everything, every day, i'll be setting days for partiicular activities.

- Gym 3x a week, running 2x
- Piano practice twice per week (monday, thursday)
- Side project twice per week (tuesday, friday / weekend)
- Daily "Learn something new" for 1 hour in the morning before work
- Complete my daily

These will all be tracked using beeminder, with public links available here -

## Goals

- Run a 5k in 25 minutes
- Move away from England (could be another difficult year for this - lets see how this one goes)
- Play a full song on piano
- Create and release a song
- Build & release my first online game ("io" style)
- Build & release my first SAAS product

There are a few career / personal goals i've kept from the list, with the above being those i'm happy being public for now.

Have a good new year all, thanks for reading.
