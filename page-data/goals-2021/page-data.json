Living in the UK and faced with lockdown for most of the year, my goals shifted a lot from taking on the world, to staying sane!</p>\n<p>At a retrospective - it’s fair to say In the past I have been over ambitious with my goal selection.</p>\n<p>I have tried the extreme, listing every area in my life, setting goals, then projects against them etc. Whilst I do believe this promotes a well balanced life and I really like the idea on paper - for me it becomes an operation burdon, and a drain on my energy juggling goals in every area, continuously.</p>\n<p>This year I want to rely on habits more, reducing required motivation to achieve a lot more, getting “free” productivity in certain areas. E.G daily medititation / journaling</p>\n<p>Outside my my habits, whilst i’ll stick with goals - I prefer not to always rely on well defined projects projects and tasks (although they certainly have a place). Instead focus on a daily highlight, that makes my day “worth it”.</p>\n<h2>Habits</h2>\n<p>In order to improve habits stickyness, and not overwhelm myself trying to tackle everything, every day, i’ll be setting days for partiicular activities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gym 3x a week, running 2x</li>\n<li>Piano practice twice per week (monday, thursday)</li>\n<li>Side project twice per week (tuesday, friday / weekend)</li>\n<li>Daily “Learn something new” for 1 hour in the morning before work</li>\n<li>Complete my daily</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These will all be tracked using beeminder, with public links available here -</p>\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Run a 5k in 25 minutes</li>\n<li>Move away from England (could be another difficult year for this - lets see how this one goes)</li>\n<li>Play a full song on piano</li>\n<li>Create and release a song</li>\n<li>Build &#x26; release my first online game (“io” style)</li>\n<li>Build &#x26; release my first SAAS product</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a few career / personal goals i’ve kept from the list, with the above being those i’m happy being public for now.</p>\n<p>Have a good new year all, thanks for reading.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Goals 2021","date":"January 29, 2021","description":"Lets kick my blog off with something fun, here's my goals for the upcoming year"}},"previous":null,"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"6a534054-99e6-5cdf-9dc5-dec9f0fe9bf9","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2241071305","2841359383"]}
